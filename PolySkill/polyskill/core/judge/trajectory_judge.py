These requirements may include conducting searches, verifying information, comparing prices, checking availability, or any other action relevant to the specified web service (such as Amazon, Apple, ArXiv, BBC News, Booking etc).

2. Result Screenshots: This is a visual representation of the screen showing the result or intermediate state of performing a web task. It serves as visual proof of the actions taken in response to the instruction.

3. Result Response: This is a textual response obtained after the execution of the web task. It serves as textual result in response to the instruction.

-- You DO NOT NEED to interact with web pages or perform actions such as booking flights or conducting searches on websites.
-- You SHOULD NOT make assumptions based on information not presented in the screenshot when comparing it to the instructions.
-- Your primary responsibility is to conduct a thorough assessment of the web task instruction against the outcome depicted in the screenshot and in the response, evaluating whether the actions taken align with the given instructions.
-- NOTE that the instruction may involve more than one task, for example, locating the garage and summarizing the review. Failing to complete either task, such as not providing a summary, should be considered unsuccessful.
-- NOTE that the screenshot is authentic, but the response provided by LLM is generated at the end of web browsing, and there may be discrepancies between the text and the screenshots.
-- Note the difference: 1) Result response may contradict the screenshot, then the content of the screenshot prevails, 2) The content in the Result response is not mentioned on the screenshot, choose to believe the content.

You should elaborate on how you arrived at your final evaluation and then provide a definitive verdict on whether the task has been successfully accomplished, either as 'SUCCESS' or 'FAILURE'."""

Your response must strictly follow the following evaluation criteria!
*Important Evaluation Criteria*:
1: The filtered results must be displayed correctly. If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.
2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as "best," "highest," "cheapest," "latest," "most recent," "lowest," "closest," "highest-rated," "largest," and "newest" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).
3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!
4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.
5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.
6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click "Save" or "Submit," etc.), it should be considered a failure.

- If the requirement is $1500-$2500, but the applied filter is $2000-$2500, it is a failure.
- If the requirement is $25-$200, but the applied filter is $0-$200, it is a failure.
- If the required years are 2004-2012, but the filter applied is 2001-2012, it is a failure.
- If the required years are before 2015, but the applied filter is 2000-2014, it is a failure.
- If the task requires exactly 2 beds, but the filter applied is 2+ beds, it is a failure.
5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful.
6: If the retrieved information is invalid or empty(e.g., No match was found), but the agent has correctly performed the required action, it should still be considered successful.
7: If the current page already displays all available items, then applying a filter is not necessary. As long as the agent selects items that meet the requirements (e.g., the cheapest or lowest price), the task is still considered successful.
