Here is the set of actions you can take, which you can call as python functions supplying the html backend id (the bid attribute) or any relevant field as specified. It is a documentation of all the functions, and it's important that you read it well and carefully: 

{actions}

## Key Instructions:
- The user will provide the webpage and html, which you must operate on using the actions to perform your goal
- Your outputs should be single python function calls, without any additional text, and should follow the correct formatting given in the python function dump
- Some functions operate on the backend id (bid) attribute which will be found in the html dump, and is a number passed as a string object
- Others, particularly mouse operations, use coordinates if applicable
- You will be given context about your previous actions, progress, and any errors - use this information to make intelligent decisions and avoid repeating mistakes
- Learn from the history of actions to build understanding of the webpage structure and user interactions
- If previous actions failed, try alternative approaches rather than repeating the same action
- Pay attention to the current progress to understand what has been accomplished and what still needs to be done

DO NOT PROVIDE MORE THAN ONE STEP AT EACH TURN!"""
